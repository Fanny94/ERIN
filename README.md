# ERIN
Game project developed by 6 students at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

To start the game, run ERIN.exe found in the Release folder.

Desc: The game, named Expulsion, is a Twin stick shooter where the player is controlling a spaceship. The goal is to clear each floor of a big station, from monsters. The player has 6 lives and when the player dies, the game ends. In the end of the game the player can see how many floors was cleared.   

Every asset/model and its texture in the game is imported from a customized format created by some of the developers of the game. Here is a link to the exporter of the custom format: https://github.com/Fanny94/Custom-exporter.

Limitations: - The game must be played on a windows PC and Requires a wired Xbox 360 Controller.
             - The code can be executed in visual studio but only in Release x86.
             - When importing files from the custom format, the .data file must be in the custom_files folder and the associated texture                  must be in the tx folder.
